It is chronologically the third of the four Grand Slam tennis events every year, held after the Australian Open and the French Open and before the US Open. It is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and is widely regarded as the most prestigious.[1][2][3][4][5]\\nWimbledon has been held since 1877 and is played on outdoor grass courts with retractable roofs over the two main courts since 2019. It is the only major still played on grass, the traditional tennis playing surface. It is also the only major that retains a night-time curfew, though matches can now continue until 23:00 under the lights.\\nThe tournament traditionally takes place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting either on the last Monday in June or the first Monday in July and culminating with the Ladies\\' and Gentlemen\\'s Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place. In 2009, Wimbledon\\'s Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. A roof was operational over No. 1 Court from 2019,[6] when a number of other improvements were made, including adding cushioned seating, a table and 10 independently operable cameras per court to capture the games.\\nWimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors, and royal patronage. Strawberries and cream are traditionally consumed at the tournament,[7] in latter years accompanied by Champagne.[8] Unlike other tournaments, advertising is minimal and low-key from official suppliers such as Slazenger and Rolex. The relationship with Slazenger is the world\\'s longest-running sporting sponsorship, providing balls for the tournament since 1902.[9]\\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Wimbledon 2020 was cancelled, the first cancellation of the tournament since World War II.[10] The rescheduled 134th edition was staged from 28 June 2021 to 11 July 2021. The 135th edition was played between 27 June 2022 and 10 July 2022, and regularly scheduled play occurred in the middle of Sunday for the first time. It marked the centenary of the inaugural championships staged at the Centre Court. The ATP, ITF, and WTA did not award ranking points for the 2022 tournament, due to controversy over the tournament excluding players representing Russia and Belarus.\\nStarting with the 2025 Wimbledon Championships, all in-person line judges will be replaced by electronic line calling system for the first time in the tournament\\'s 147-year history and the 2025 Wimbledon Championships will run from 30 June to 13 July.\\nHistory\\n[edit]\\nBeginning\\n[edit]\\n\\nSpencer Gore, the winner of the inaugural Wimbledon Championship\\nThe All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club is a private club founded on 23 July 1868, originally as \"The All England Croquet Club\". Its first ground was at Nursery Road off Worple Road, Wimbledon.[11]\\nIn 1876, lawn tennis, a game devised by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield[12] a year or so earlier as an outdoor version of real tennis and originally given the name Sphairistikè, was added to the activities of the club. In spring 1877, the club was renamed \"The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club\" and signalled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship. A new code of laws, replacing the code administered by the Marylebone Cricket Club, was drawn up for the event. Today\\'s rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and posts and the distance of the service line from the net.\\nThe inaugural 1877 Wimbledon Championship started on 9 July 1877 and the Gentlemen\\'s Singles was the only event held. 22 men paid a guinea to enter the tournament, which was to be held over five days. The rain delayed it four more days and thus, on 19 July 1877, the final was played. Spencer Gore, an Old Harrovian rackets player, defeated William Marshall 6–1, 6–2 and 6–4 in 48 minutes. Gore was presented with the silver challenge cup, valued at 25 guineas and donated by the sports magazine The Field, as well as a prize money of 12 guineas. About 200 spectators paid one shilling each to watch the final.[13]\\nThe lawns at the ground were arranged so that the principal court was in the middle with the others arranged around it, hence the title \"Centre Court\".[d] The name was retained when the Club moved in 1922 to the present site in Church Road, although no longer a true description of its location.[15] However, in 1980 four new courts were brought into commission on the north side of the ground, which meant the Centre Court was once more correctly described. The opening of the new No. 1 Court in 1997 emphasised the description.\\n\\nLadies Championship, 1884. First prize, awarded to Maud Watson, was a silver flower-basket worth 20 guineas.\\nBy 1882, activity at the club was almost exclusively confined to lawn tennis and that year the word \"croquet\" was dropped from the title. However, for sentimental reasons it was restored in 1899.\\nIn 1884, the club added the Ladies\\' Singles competition and the Gentlemen\\'s Doubles was transferred from the Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club. Ladies\\' doubles and mixed doubles events were added in 1913. The first black player to compete at Wimbledon was Bertrand Milbourne Clark, an amateur from Jamaica, in 1924.[16]\\nUntil 1922, the reigning champion had to play only in the final, against whoever had won through to challenge them. As with the other three Major or Grand Slam events, Wimbledon was contested by top-ranked amateur players; professional players were prohibited from participating. This changed with the advent of the open era in 1968. No British man won the singles event at Wimbledon between Fred Perry in 1936 and Andy Murray in 2013, while no British woman has won since Virginia Wade in 1977, although Annabel Croft and Laura Robson won the Girls\\' Championship in 1984 and 2008 respectively. The Championship was first televised in 1937.\\nThough formally called \"The Championships, Wimbledon\", depending on sources the event is also known as \"The All England Lawn Tennis Championships\", the \"Wimbledon Championships\" or simply \"Wimbledon\". From 1912 to 1924, the tournament was recognized by the International Lawn Tennis Federation as the \"World Grass Court Championships\".\\nIn the period of 1915–1918, no tournament was organised due to World War I. During World War II, the tournament was not held in the period 1940–1945. On 11 October 1940 one bomb hit a corner of the competitors’ stand of the Centre Court. The championships did go ahead in 1946 even though the damage meant that 1,200 seats were lost. The organisers were unable to repair the damaged section until 1947 and the Centre Court was fully restored and renovated for the 1949 edition.[17]\\nIn 1946 and 1947 Wimbledon was held before the French Championships. It was thus the second Grand Slam tennis event of the year.\\n21st century\\n[edit]\\nWimbledon is widely considered the world\\'s premier tennis tournament and the priority of the club is to maintain its leadership. To that end a long-term plan was unveiled in 1993, intended to improve the quality of the event for spectators, players, officials and neighbours.[18] Stage one (1994–1997) of the plan was completed for the 1997 championships and involved building the new No. 1 Court in Aorangi Park, a broadcast centre, two extra grass courts and a tunnel under the hill linking Church Road and Somerset Road. Stage two (1997–2009) involved the removal of the old No. 1 Court complex to make way for the new Millennium Building, providing extensive facilities for players, press, officials and members, and the extension of the West Stand of the Centre Court with 728 extra seats. Stage three (2000–2011) was completed with the construction of an entrance building, club staff housing, museum, bank and ticket office.[19]\\nA new retractable roof was built in time for the 2009 championships, marking the first time that rain did not stop play for a lengthy time on Centre Court. The Club tested the new roof at an event called A Centre Court Celebration on Sunday, 17 May 2009, which featured exhibition matches involving Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf, Kim Clijsters, and Tim Henman. The first Championship match to take place under the roof was the completion of the fourth round women\\'s singles match between Dinara Safina and Amélie Mauresmo. The first match to be played in its entirety under the new roof took place between Andy Murray and Stanislas Wawrinka on 29 June 2009. Murray was also involved in the match completed latest in the day at Wimbledon, which ended at 11:02\\xa0pm in a victory over Marcos Baghdatis at Centre Court in the third round of the 2012 Championships. The 2012 Gentlemen\\'s Singles Final on 8 July 2012, between Roger Federer and Murray, was the first singles final to be partially played under the roof, which was activated during the third set.[e]\\nA new 4,000-seat No. 2 Court was built on the site of the old No. 13 Court in time for the 2009 Championships.[20] A new 2,000-seat No. 3 Court was built on the site of the old No. 2 and No. 3 Courts.[21]\\nOn 1 August 2011, the All England Club transferred all of its assets relating to The Championships to a separate though wholly owned subsidiary, The All England Lawn Tennis Club (Championships) Limited, also known as AELTC. Since that time, the club\\'s activities have been formally conducted separately from those of The Championships.[22]\\nIn 2012, the All England Club hosted the Summer Olympic Games and became the first Olympic grass court tournament since tennis was reintroduced as an Olympic sport and the first to be held at a Grand Slam venue in the Open era.[23]\\nIn April 2013, Wimbledon unveiled its \\'Master Plan\\' a vision in which to improve the championships over the next 10–15 years. This was in large part due to other Grand Slam tournaments such as the French Open and Australian Open also announcing expansion and re-development plans.[24][25] Aspects of the master plan included new player and media facilities, expansion of the No.1 court including a new retractable roof, new catering and hospitality areas, additional floor to the museum building, construction of an underground car park and new indoor courts and also a total reconfiguration of the site including the relocation of a number of practice, clay and championship courts.[26]\\nPart of the plan also includes acquiring the land of the adjacent Wimbledon Park Golf club for £65\\xa0million, so that the tournament qualifying matches can be played on site.[27]\\nOn 19 October 2018, it was announced that a tie-break will be played if the score reaches 12–12 in the final set of any match; this will apply to all competitions including in qualifying, singles, and doubles.[28][29] In a related statement, it was announced that starting at the 2019 Championships, quad wheelchair competitions would become a permanent event.[30]\\n\\nCentre Court at Wimbledon in May 2019\\nAs a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the All England Club announced on 1 April 2020 that the entire grass-court season was to be cancelled as a public safety precaution until June 2021, marking the first time a Wimbledon tournament would not be played since World War II.[31] Club officials considered playing the tournament behind closed doors, but this was ruled out in part because at least 5,000 people–including ballboys, officials, coaches, maintenance, and security–would have still needed to be on site to hold a functioning tournament. Former player and current All England Club board member Tim Henman told the Tennis Channel of the US that the board had carefully considered holding a closed-door Wimbledon. However, the sheer number of people who still would have needed to be on site led the board to realise \"that wasn\\'t going to be a workable option\".[32] Prior to the start of the 2003 tournament, the club began paying an annual insurance premium of £1.61m ($2\\xa0million) to cover losses from cancellation of Wimbledon in the event of a worldwide pandemic as a result of the SARS outbreak; it would receive an insurance payment of £114\\xa0million ($141\\xa0million) for the 2020 cancellation on expected losses of around £250\\xa0million ($312\\xa0million).[33]\\nIn April 2022, due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the All England Club announced that Russian and Belarusian players would be prohibited from competing in the tournament. Unlike the ATP and WTA, participation as neutral athletes is also prohibited.[34] On 20 May 2022, the ATP, ITF, and WTA announced that they will not award ranking points for the tournament, as they considered the prohibition unilateral, and constituted discrimination against players based on nationality.[35] On 31 March 2023, the ban on Russian and Belarusian players was lifted by the All England Club.[36]\\nOn 9 October 2024, it was announced that line judges would be replaced by electronic line calling technology on all courts starting at the 2025 Championship.[37][38]\\nEvents\\n[edit]\\nWimbledon consists of five main events, four junior events and seven invitation events.[39]\\nMain events\\n[edit]\\nThe five main events, and the number of players (or teams, in the case of doubles) are:\\n\\nGentlemen\\'s Singles (128)\\nLadies\\' Singles (128)\\nGentlemen\\'s Doubles (64)\\nLadies\\' Doubles (64)\\nMixed Doubles (32)\\n\\nJunior events\\n[edit]\\nThe four junior events and the number of players or teams are:\\n\\nBoys\\' Singles (64)\\nGirls\\' Singles (64)\\nBoys\\' Doubles (32)\\nGirls\\' Doubles (32)\\n\\nNo mixed doubles event is held at this level\\nInvitation events\\n[edit]\\nThe seven invitational events and the number of pairs are:\\n\\nGentlemen\\'s Invitation Doubles (8 pairs Round Robin)[f]\\nLadies\\' Invitation Doubles (8 pairs Round Robin)\\nSenior Gentlemen\\'s Invitation Doubles (8 pairs Round Robin)[g]\\nGentlemen\\'s Wheelchair Singles[40]\\nLadies\\' Wheelchair Singles\\nGentlemen\\'s Wheelchair Doubles (4 pairs)[41]\\nLadies\\' Wheelchair Doubles (4 pairs)[41]\\n\\nMatch formats\\n[edit]\\nMatches in the Gentlemen\\'s Singles are best-of-five sets. In 2023 it was decided that Gentlemen\\'s Doubles match formats will be changed from best-of-five sets to best-of-three sets due to complaints from partaking players;[42] all other events are best-of-three sets. Up to and including the 2018 tournament, a tiebreak game is played if the score reaches 6–all in any set except the fifth (in a five-set match) or the third (in a three-set match), in which case a two-game lead must be reached. Since 2019, a final set tiebreak game is played if the score in the final set reaches 12–all.[28] In 2022 it was decided all matches would have a final set tiebreak once the match reached 6–6, with a champions tiebreak taking place meaning the winner needs to get to 10 points and win by two points.[43][44] If the score is 9–9 play continues until one player wins by two points.\\nAll events are single-elimination tournaments,[h] except for the Gentlemen\\'s, Senior Gentlemen\\'s and the Ladies\\' Invitation Doubles, which are round-robin tournaments.\\nUp to 1921, the winners of the previous year\\'s competition (except in the Ladies\\' Doubles and Mixed Doubles) were automatically granted byes into the final round (then known as the challenge round). This led to many winners retaining their titles in successive years, as they were able to rest while their opponent competed from the start of the competition. Since 1922, the prior year\\'s champions were required to play all the rounds, like other tournament competitors.\\nSchedule\\n[edit]\\nEach year the tournament begins on the last Monday in June or first Monday in July, two weeks after the Queen\\'s Club Championships, which is one of the men\\'s major warm-up tournaments, together with the Gerry Weber Open, which is held in Halle, Germany, during the same week. Other grass-court tournaments before Wimbledon are Eastbourne, Great Britain, and Rosmalen in the Netherlands, both combining mixed events. The other women\\'s warm-up tournament for Wimbledon is Birmingham, also in Great Britain. The men\\'s event which is outside Europe before Wimbledon is the Antalya open in Turkey. The only grass-court tournament scheduled after the Championships is the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships at Newport, Rhode Island, USA, which takes place the week after Wimbledon.\\nSince 2015, the championships have begun one week later than in previous years, extending the gap between the tournament and the French Open from two to three weeks.[45] Additionally the Stuttgart Open men\\'s tournament converted to a grass surface and was rescheduled from July to June, extending the grass court season. Wimbledon is scheduled for 14 days, beginning on a Monday and ending on a Sunday. Before 1982 it ended a day earlier, with the women\\'s singles final on the Friday and the men\\'s singles final on the Saturday.[46] The five main events span both weeks, but the junior and invitational events are held mainly during the second week.\\nTraditionally, unlike the other three tennis Grand Slams, there was no play on the \"Middle Sunday\", which was considered a rest day. However, rain had forced play on the Middle Sunday four times, in 1991, 1997, 2004 and 2016. On the first of these four occasions, Wimbledon staged a \"People\\'s Sunday\", with unreserved seating and readily available, inexpensive tickets, allowing those with more limited means to sit on the show courts.\\nIn 2022, on the centenary of the tournament\\'s move to its current site, routine scheduled play began on the \"Middle Sunday\".[47] This was attributed to advances in grass technology and maintenance meaning the courts no longer required a day of recovery mid-tournament.[47]\\nBefore 2022, the second Monday at Wimbledon was often called \"Manic Monday\", because it was the busiest day with the last-16 matches for both men\\'s and women\\'s singles. Fans had a pick of watching on a single day any of the best 32 players left, which was also unique in a Grand Slam singles competition.[48]\\nCurfew\\n[edit]\\nSince 2009 all matches have to finish before 11:00pm. Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam that retains a night-time curfew. The curfew is in place to protect local residents from late-night disturbances. When the roof was built on Centre Court—something that allowed matches to continue at night under the lights—the local Merton Council put the time limit into place when granting planning permission for the roof.[49] A statement from Wimbledon in 2018 read: “The 11pm curfew is a Planning Condition applied to balance the consideration of the local residents with the scale of an international tennis event that takes place in a residential area. The challenge of transport connectivity and getting visitors home safely is also a key consideration.”[50]\\nPlayers and seeding\\n[edit]\\nBoth the men\\'s and ladies\\' singles consist of 128 players.[51] Players and doubles pairs are admitted to the main events on the basis of their international rankings, with 104 direct entries into the men\\'s and 108 into the ladies\\' competitions. Both tournaments have 8 wild card entrants, with the remainder in each made up of qualifiers. Since the 2001 tournament, 32 players have been given seedings in the Gentlemen\\'s and Ladies\\' singles, 16 teams in the doubles events. The system of seeding was introduced during the 1924 Wimbledon Championships. This was a simplified version allowing countries to nominate four players who were placed in different quarters of the draw. This system was replaced for the 1927 Wimbledon Championships and from then on players were seeded on merit. The first players to be seeded as no. 1 were René Lacoste and Helen Wills.[52]\\nThe Committee of Management decide which players receive wildcards. Usually, wild cards are players who have performed well during previous tournaments or would stimulate public interest in Wimbledon by participating. The only wild card to win the Gentlemen\\'s Singles Championship was Goran Ivanišević in 2001. Players and pairs who neither have high enough rankings nor receive wild cards may participate in a qualifying tournament held one week before Wimbledon at the Bank of England Sports Ground in Roehampton. The singles qualifying competitions are three-round events. From 2019 singles qualification will increase to 128 players and no doubles qualification will occur.[30] Previously the same-sex doubles competitions lasted for only two rounds. There is no qualifying tournament for Mixed Doubles. The furthest that any qualifier has progressed in a Singles tournament is the semi-final round: John McEnroe in 1977 (Gentlemen\\'s Singles), Vladimir Voltchkov in 2000 (Gentlemen\\'s Singles), and Alexandra Stevenson in 1999 (Ladies\\' Singles).[citation needed]\\nPlayers are admitted to the junior tournaments upon the recommendations of their national tennis associations, on their International Tennis Federation world rankings and, in the case of the singles events, on the basis of a qualifying competition. The Committee of Management determines which players may enter the four invitational events.\\nThe Committee seeds the top players and pairs on the basis of their rankings, but it could change the seedings based on a player\\'s previous grass court performance. Since 2002 a seeding committee has not been required for the Gentlemen\\'s Singles following an agreement with the ATP, and since the 2021 tournament, the seeding has followed the same process as the ATP rankings.[53] From 2002 to 2019, the top 32 players (according to the ATP rankings) were seeded according to a formula that more heavily weighted previous grass-court tournaments: ATP Entry System Position points + 100% points earned for all grass court tournaments in the past 12 months + 75% points earned for the best grass court tournament in the 12 months before that.[54][55]\\nA majority of the entrants are unseeded. Only two unseeded players have won the Gentlemen\\'s Singles: Boris Becker in 1985 and Goran Ivanišević in 2001. In 1985 there were only 16 seeds and Becker was ranked 20th; Ivanišević was ranked 125th when he won as a Wild Card entrant, although he had previously been a finalist three times, and been ranked no. 2 in the world; his low ranking was due to having been hampered by a persistent shoulder injury for three years, which had only just cleared up. In 1996, the title was won by Richard Krajicek, who was originally unseeded (ranked 17th, and only 16 players were seeded) but was promoted to a seeded position (still with the number 17) when Thomas Muster withdrew before the tournament. In 2023, the Ladies\\' Singles title was captured for the first time by an unseeded player, Marketa Vondrousova, who ranked 42 in the world.[56] Previously, the lowest seeded female champion was Venus Williams, who won in 2007 as the 23rd seed; Williams was returning from an injury that had prevented her playing in previous tournaments, giving her a lower ranking than she would normally have had. Unseeded pairs have won the doubles titles on numerous occasions; the 2005 Gentlemen\\'s Doubles champions were not only unseeded, but also (for the first time ever) qualifiers.\\nGrounds\\n[edit]\\n\\nAerial view of the grounds\\nMain article: All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club\\nSince 2001, the courts used for Wimbledon have been sown with 100% perennial ryegrass. Prior to 2001 a combination of 70% ryegrass and 30% Creeping Red Fescue was used. The change was made to improve durability and strengthen the sward to better withstand the increasing wear of the modern game.[57]\\nThe main show courts, Centre Court and No. 1 Court, are normally used for only two weeks a year, during the Championships, but play can extend into a third week in exceptional circumstances. The remaining 17 courts are regularly used for other events hosted by the club. The show courts were in action for the second time in three months in 2012 as Wimbledon hosted the tennis events of the 2012 Olympic Games. One of the show courts is also used for home ties for the Great Britain teams in the Davis Cup on occasions.\\nWimbledon is the only remaining Grand Slam event played on natural grass courts. At one time, all the Majors, except the French Open, were played on grass. The US Open abandoned grass in 1975 for green clay and the Australian Open did so in 1988 for hard courts; the US Open eventually adopted hard courts as well.\\nFrom 1877 until 1921, the club\\'s grounds were situated on four acres of meadowland in central Wimbledon between Worple Road and the railway line. In 1908, this venue hosted the tennis events for the 1908 Summer Olympic Games. As the attendance at the Championships grew, it became obvious before the First World War that the 8,000 ground capacity at Worple Road was inadequate, and so the Club started looking for a new site. It eventually settled on an area of land off Church Road, to the north of Wimbledon town centre, and moved to its new home in 1922. At the time the relocation was regarded as something of a financial gamble, costing as it did approximately £140,000. After the Club moved to the current site in Church Road, the old Worple Road ground then became the Wimbledon High School playing field, which it remains today.\\nThe principal court at Church Road, Centre Court, was inaugurated in 1922. The new venue was substantially larger and was needed to meet the ever-growing public demand.\\n\\nThe order of play for all courts is displayed on boards around the grounds.\\nDue to the possibility of rain during Wimbledon, a retractable roof was installed prior to the 2009 Championship. It is designed to close/open fully in 20 minutes and will be closed primarily to protect play from inclement (and, if necessary, extremely hot) weather during The Championships.[58] Whilst the roof is being opened or closed, play is suspended. The first time the roof was closed during a Wimbledon Championship match was on Monday 29 June 2009, involving Amélie Mauresmo and Dinara Safina. The first full match played and completed under the roof featured Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka, played on the same date.\\nThe court has a capacity of 14,979. At its south end is the Royal Box, from which members of the Royal Family and other dignitaries watch matches. Centre Court usually hosts the finals and semifinals of the main events, as well as many matches in the earlier rounds involving top-seeded players or local favourites.\\nThe second most important court is No. 1 Court. The court was constructed in 1997 to replace the old No.1 Court, which was adjacent to Centre Court. The old No.1 Court was demolished because its capacity for spectators was too low. The court was said to have had a unique, more intimate atmosphere and was a favourite of many players. Construction of a new retractable roof on the No.1 Court began after the 2017 Championships and was completed in time for the 2019 championships. The capacity of the stadium also rose by 900 to 12,345.[59]\\nSince 2009, a new No. 2 Court has been used at Wimbledon with a capacity for 4,000 people. To obtain planning permission, the playing surface is around 3.5m below ground level, ensuring that the single-storey structure is only about 3.5m above ground level, and thus not affecting local views.[60] Plans to build on the current site of Court 13 were dismissed due to the high capacity of games played at the 2012 Olympic Games. The old No.2 Court has been renamed as No.3 Court. The old No.2 Court was known as the \"Graveyard of Champions\" because many highly seeded players were eliminated there during early rounds over the years, including Ilie Năstase, John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Martina Hingis, Venus Williams, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova.[61] The court has a capacity of 2,192 + 770 standing. In 2011 a new No.3 Court and a new Court 4 were unveiled on the sites of the old No.2 and 3 courts.[62]\\n\\nView from seats of Wimbledon Court No. 1\\nBecause of the summer climate in southern England, Wimbledon employs \\'Court Attendants\\' each year, who work to maintain court conditions. Their principal responsibility is to ensure that the courts are quickly covered when it begins to rain, so that play can resume as quickly as possible once the referees decide to uncover the courts. The outer court attendants are mainly university students working to make summer money. Centre Court is covered by full-time groundstaff, however.\\nAt the northern end of the grounds is a giant television screen on which important matches are broadcast to fans inside the grounds without tickets to the relevant court. Fans watch from a gently inclined area of grass officially known as the Aorangi Terrace. When British players do well at Wimbledon, this area attracts fans for them, and is often renamed after them by the press: Greg Rusedski\\'s followers convened at \"Rusedski Ridge\", and Tim Henman has had the hill nicknamed Henman Hill. As both of them have now retired and Andy Murray is the most successful current British player, the hill is occasionally referred to as \"Murray Mound\" or \"Murrayfield\", as a reference to his Scottish heritage and the Scottish rugby ground of the same name, but this has largely failed to catch on – the area is still often referred to as Henman Hill.[citation needed] None of these nicknames are the official name.\\n1913 suffragette terror attack\\n[edit]\\nSee also: Suffragette bombing and arson campaign\\nAn attempt was made to destroy the grounds in 1913, during the suffragette bombing and arson campaign. The suffragettes, as part of their campaign for women\\'s votes before the First World War, had begun carrying out politically motivated arson and bombings across the country.[63] On the night of 27 February 1913, a suffragette woman \"between the ages of 30–35\" was arrested within the grounds, after being spotted by a groundsman climbing over a hedge at around midnight.[64] She was found to have with her some paraffin and wood shavings, for the purpose of setting fires in the grounds.[64] The woman refused to give her name or any information to the police and was later sentenced to two months\\' imprisonment.[64]\\nBank of England Sports Centre\\n[edit]\\nThe qualifying matches, prior to the main draw, take place at the Bank of England Sports Ground, in Roehampton, 3.6 miles (5.8\\xa0km) from the All England Club.[65]\\nTraditions\\n[edit]\\n\\nCourt 10. On the outside courts there is no reserved seating.\\nSocial commentator Ellis Cashmore describes Wimbledon as having \"a David Niven-ish propriety\", in trying to conform to the standards of behaviour regarded as common in the 1950s. Writer Peter York sees the event as representing a particular white, upper middle class, affluent type of Britishness, describing the area of Wimbledon as \"a southern, well off, late-Victorian suburb with a particular social character\". Cashmore has criticised the event for being \"remote and insulated\" from the changing multicultural character of modern Britain, describing it as \"nobody\\'s idea of all-things-British\".[66][importance?]\\nBall boys and ball girls\\n[edit]\\nIn the championship games, ball boys and girls, known as BBGs, have a brief that a good BBG \"should not be seen. They should blend into the background and get on with their jobs quietly.\"[67]\\nFrom 1947 ball boys were recruited from Goldings,[68] the only Barnardos school to provide them. Prior to this, from the 1920s onwards, the ball boys came from The Shaftesbury Children\\'s Home.\\n\\nWimbledon ball girl at the net, 2007\\nSince 1969, BBGs have been drawn from local schools. Traditionally, Wandsworth Boys School in Sutherland Grove, Southfields and Mayfield Girls School on West Hill in Wandsworth (only Southfields remains extant), were the schools of choice for selection of BBGs. This was possibly owing to their proximity to the club. Since 2008 they have been drawn from schools in the London boroughs of Merton, Sutton, Kingston, and Wandsworth, as well as from Surrey.[69] BBGs have an average age of 15, being drawn from the school years nine and ten.[70] They serve for one, or if re-selected, for up to five tournaments, up to year thirteen.[71]\\nStarting in 2005, BBGs work in teams of six, two at the net, four at the corners, and teams rotate one hour on court, one hour off, (two hours depending on the court) for the day\\'s play.[70] Teams are not told which court they will be working on the day, to ensure the same standards across all courts. With the expansion of the number of courts, and lengthening the tennis day, as of 2008, the number of BBGs required is around 250. Starting on the second Wednesday, the number of BBGs is reduced due to the decrease in the number of matches per day, leaving around 80 on the final Sunday. Each BBG receives a certificate, a can of used balls, a group photograph and a programme when leaving. BBG service is paid, with a total of £160-£250 being paid to each ball boy or girl after the 13-day period, depending on the number of days served, around £17 per day. Every BBG keeps their kit. BBG places are split 50:50 between boys and girls, with girls having been included since 1977, appearing on centre court since 1985.[72]\\nProspective BBGs are first nominated by their school headteacher, to be considered for selection. To be selected, a candidate must pass written tests on the rules of tennis, and pass fitness, mobility and other suitability tests, against initial preliminary instruction material. Successful candidates then commence a training phase, starting in February, in which the final BBGs are chosen through continual assessment. As of 2008, this training intake was 600. The training includes weekly sessions of physical, procedural and theoretical instruction, to ensure that the BBGs are fast, alert, self-confident and adaptable to situations. As of 2011, early training occurs at the Wimbledon All England Lawn Tennis Club Covered Courts, to the side of the Grounds, and then moves to outside courts (8, 9, 10) the week before the Championships to ensure that BBGs gain a feel of the grass court.[citation needed]\\nUmpires\\n[edit]\\nAt The Championships at Wimbledon, forty-two chair umpires are assigned each day and usually work two matches a day. They use tablet computers to score each match and these scores are displayed on the scoreboards and on wimbledon.com.[73] Line umpires worked in teams of nine or seven. Teams of nine umpires worked the Centre Court and Court numbers 1, 2, 3, 12, and 18 with the remaining teams of seven working the other courts. These teams rotated, working sixty minutes on the court and then sixty minutes off.\\nIn 2007 a new technology called Hawk-Eye was introduced.[74] This technology showed whether the ball bounced in bounds or out. Wimbledon started using this technology but continued to use line umpires as well. However the players were only allowed to ask to see this 3 times during one set.[75]\\nLine umpires and the ability to challenge calls made during a match were axed, starting from the 2025 Championships, due to the professional tennis tours adopting the Hawk-Eye Live technology from the 2025 season for any tournament capable of supporting it, bringing an end to the 147 years of traditional scenes of line umpires walking to and from the courts during matches. The only umpire on the court will now be the chair umpire, although the new role of match assistants will be created to escort players to the bathroom or take their racquets to the stringer.[37][38]\\nColours and uniforms\\n[edit]\\n\\nSébastien Grosjean takes a shot on Court 18 during the 2004 Championships.\\nDark green and purple are the traditional Wimbledon colours. However, all tennis players participating in the tournament are required to wear all-white or at least almost all-white clothing, a long-time tradition at Wimbledon.[76][i] This rule was put in place in 1963, when the tournament\\'s first dress code was enforced.[79] Wearing white clothing with some colour accents is also acceptable, provided the colour scheme is not that of an identifiable commercial brand logo (the outfitter\\'s brand logo being the sole exception). Controversy followed Martina Navratilova\\'s wearing branding for \"Kim\" cigarettes in 1982. In 2023 rules first allowed all female players, included but not limited to in the girls’ singles junior event, to wear non-white underwear; the new rule allows \"solid, mid/dark-coloured undershorts, provided they are no longer than their shorts or skirt\".[77] Green clothing was worn by the chair umpire, linesmen, ball boys and ball girls until the 2005 Championships; however, beginning with the 2006 Championships, officials, ball boys and ball girls were dressed in new navy blue- and cream-coloured uniforms from American designer Ralph Lauren.\\nReferring to players\\n[edit]\\nBy tradition, the \"Men\\'s\" and \"Women\\'s\" competitions are referred to as \"Gentlemen\\'s\" and \"Ladies\\'\" competitions at Wimbledon. The junior competitions are referred to as the \"Boys\\'\" and \"Girls\\'\" competitions.\\nPrior to 2009, female players were referred to by the title \"Miss\" or \"Mrs\" on scoreboards. On the Wimbledon\\'s Champions Board, married female players were referred to by their husband\\'s name up until 2019. For the first time during the 2009 tournament, players were referred to on scoreboards by both their first and last names.[80]\\nThe title \"Mr\" is not used for male players who are professionals on scoreboards but is retained for amateurs, although chair umpires refer to players as \"Mr\" when they use the replay challenge. The chair umpire will say \"Mr <surname> is challenging the call...\" and \"Mr. <surname> has X challenges remaining.\" Up until 2018, the chair umpire said \"Miss\"/\"Mrs\" <surname> when announcing the score of the Ladies\\' matches. However, the chair umpire no longer calls \"Miss\"/\"Mrs\" <surname> when announcing the score, since 2019.[81] As of the 2022 edition of the tournament, the use of Mr, Miss and Mrs was eliminated: players are now referred to by their names, as written on the scoreboard by the umpire at all points in a match.\\nIf a match is being played with two competitors of the same surname (e.g. Venus and Serena Williams, Bob and Mike Bryan), the chair umpire will specify to whom they are referring by stating the player\\'s first name and surname during announcements (e.g. \"Game, Venus Williams\", \"Advantage, Mike Bryan\").\\nRoyal family\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe Royal Gallery at Centre Court, Wimbledon\\nPreviously, players bowed or curtsied to members of the royal family seated in the Royal Box upon entering or leaving Centre Court. However, in 2003, All England Club president Prince Edward, Duke of Kent decided to discontinue the tradition. Now, players are required to bow or curtsy only if the Prince of Wales or the King is present,[82] as was in practice during the 2010 Championships when Elizabeth II was in attendance at Wimbledon on 24 June.[83] On 27 June 2012, Roger Federer said in his post-match interview that he and his opponent had been asked to bow towards the Royal Box as Prince Charles and his wife were present, saying that it was not a problem for him.[84]\\nServices stewards\\n[edit]\\n\\nA Royal Marines Commando as a services steward in 2005\\nPrior to the Second World War, members of the Brigade of Guards and retired members of the Royal Artillery performed the role of stewards. In 1946 the AELTC offered employment to wartime servicemen returning to civilian life during their demobilisation leave. Initially, this scheme extended only to the Royal Navy, followed by the British Army in 1947 and the Royal Air Force in 1949. In 1965 London Fire Brigade members joined the ranks of stewards.[85] The service stewards, wearing uniform, are present in Centre Court and No.\\'s 1, 2, 3, 12 and 18 courts.[86] In 2015, 595 Service and London Fire Brigade stewards attended.[87] Only enlisted members of the Armed Forces may apply for the role, which must be taken as leave, and half of each year\\'s recruits must have stewarded at Wimbledon before. The AELTC pays a subsistence allowance to servicemen and women working as stewards to defray their accommodation costs for the period of the Championships. The Service Stewards are not to be confused with the 185 Honorary Stewards.\\nTickets\\n[edit]\\n\\nWimbledon operates a ticket resale system where returned Show Court tickets can be purchased.[88] All proceeds go to charity.[89]\\n\\nDebenture of the All England Lawn Tennis Ground Ltd., issued 20th August 1930\\nThe majority of centre and show court tickets sold to the general public have since 1924 been made available by a public ballot that the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club holds at the start of the year.[90] The ballot has always been substantially oversubscribed. Successful applicants are selected at random by a computer.[91] The most recent figures from 2011 suggested there were four applicants to every ballot ticket. Applications must be posted to arrive at the AELTC by the last day of December in the year prior to the tournament. Seats and days are allocated randomly and ballot tickets are not transferable.\\nThe All England Club, through its subsidiary The All England Lawn Tennis Ground plc, issues debentures to tennis fans every five years to raise funds for capital expenditure. Fans who invest thus in the club receive a pair of tickets for every day of the Wimbledon Championships for the five years the investment lasts.[92] Only debenture holders are permitted to sell on their tickets to third parties and demand for debentures has increased in recent[when?] years, to such an extent that they are even traded on the London Stock Exchange.[citation needed]\\nWimbledon and the French Open are the only Grand Slam tournaments where fans without tickets for play can queue up and still get seats on the three show courts on the day of the match.[93] Sequentially numbered queue cards were introduced in 2003. From 2008, there is a single queue, allotted about 500 seats for each court. When they join the queue, fans are handed queue cards. Anyone who then wishes to leave the queue temporarily, even if in possession of a queue card, must agree their position with the others nearby in the queue or a steward.\\nTo get access to the show courts, fans normally have to queue overnight.[94] This is done by fans from all over the world and, although considered vagrancy, is part of the Wimbledon experience in itself. The All-England Club allows overnight queuing and provides toilet and water facilities for campers. Early in the morning when the line moves towards the Grounds, stewards walk along the line and hand out wristbands that are colour-coded to the specific court. The wrist band (and payment) is exchanged at the ticket office for the ticket when the grounds open. General admission to the grounds gives access to the outer courts and is possible without queuing overnight. Tickets returned by people leaving early go on sale at 2:30\\xa0pm and the money goes to charity. Queuing for the show courts ends after the quarter finals have been completed.\\nAt 2.40pm on Day Seven (Monday 28 June) of the 2010 Championships, the one-millionth numbered Wimbledon queue card was handed out to Rose Stanley from South Africa.[95][96]\\nSponsorship\\n[edit]\\nUnlike other tournaments, advertising from major brands is minimal and low key, from suppliers such as IBM, Rolex and Slazenger.[97][98] Wimbledon is notable for the longest running sponsorship in sports history due to its association with Slazenger who have supplied all tennis balls for the tournament since 1902.[99] Between 1935 and 2021, Wimbledon had a sponsorship deal with Robinsons fruit squash – one of the longest sponsorships in sport.[100]\\nStrawberries and cream\\n[edit]\\nStrawberries and cream are traditionally eaten by spectators at Wimbledon and have become culturally synonymous with the tournament. The origin of this tradition has been said to derive from a visit King Henry VIII paid to his Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, whose home was at Hampton Court, about six miles from Wimbledon, when the chancellor\\'s cook is rumoured to have served wild strawberries and cream as a dessert. Since the King ate it, the dessert gained popularity.[101] In 2017, fans consumed 34,000\\xa0kg (33 imperial tons) of British strawberries and 10,000 litres (2,200 imperial gallons) of cream. In 2019, 191,930 portions of strawberries and cream were served at The Championships at Wimbledon.[102]\\nMedia coverage and attendance\\n[edit]\\nMain article: List of Wimbledon broadcasters\\nRadio Wimbledon\\n[edit]\\nMain article: Radio Wimbledon\\nUntil 2011, when its contract ended,[103] Radio Wimbledon could be heard within a five-mile radius on 87.7 FM, and also online. It operated under a Restricted Service Licence. Presenters included Sam Lloyd and Ali Barton. Typically, they worked alternate four-hour shifts until the end of the last match of the day. Reporters and commentators included Gigi Salmon, Nick Lestor, Rupert Bell, Nigel Bidmead, Guy Swindells, Lucie Ahl, Nadine Towell and Helen Whitaker. Often, they reported from the \"Crow\\'s Nest\", an elevated building housing the Court 3 and 4 scoreboards which affords views of most of the outside courts. Regular guests included Sue Mappin. In later years, Radio Wimbledon acquired a second low-power FM frequency (within the grounds only) of 96.3 FM for uninterrupted Centre Court commentary, and, from 2006, a third for coverage from No. 1 Court on 97.8 FM. Hourly news bulletins and travel (using RDS) were also broadcast.\\nRadio Wimbledon\\'s theme tune is called \"Purple and Green\" and has been used since 1996, when it was composed by British composer Tony Cox.\\nTelevision coverage\\n[edit]\\nBeginning with the 2018 tournament, an in-house operation known as Wimbledon Broadcasting Services (WBS) has served as the official host broadcaster of the tournament, replacing BBC Sport.[104]\\nUnited Kingdom\\n[edit]\\n\\nPeople watching the Championships\\' broadcast in Canary Wharf\\nFurther information: Timeline of tennis on UK television\\nSince 1937 the BBC has broadcast the tournament on television in the United Kingdom.[105][j] Between 1956 and 1968, the Championships were also covered by the ITV Network, but since 1969 the BBC has had a monopoly. The matches covered are primarily split between its two main terrestrial channels, BBC One and BBC Two, and their Red Button service. This can result in live matches being moved across all 3 channels. The BBC holds the broadcast rights for Wimbledon until 2027.[107] During the days of British Satellite Broadcasting, its sports channel carried extra coverage of Wimbledon for subscribers. One of the most notable British commentators was Dan Maskell, who was known as the BBC\\'s \"voice of tennis\" until his retirement in 1991. John Barrett succeeded him in that role until he retired in 2006. Current commentators working for the BBC at Wimbledon include British ex-players Andrew Castle, John Lloyd, Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski, Samantha Smith and Mark Petchey; tennis legends such as John McEnroe, Tracy Austin, Boris Becker and Lindsay Davenport; and general sports commentators including David Mercer, Barry Davies, Andrew Cotter and Nick Mullins. The coverage is presented by Sue Barker (live) and Claire Balding (highlights). Previous BBC presenters include Des Lynam, David Vine, John Inverdale and Harry Carpenter.\\nThe Wimbledon Finals are obliged to be shown live and in full on terrestrial television (BBC Television Service, ITV, Channel 4, or Channel 5) by government mandate. Highlights of the rest of the tournament must be provided by terrestrial stations; live coverage (excepting the finals) may be sought by satellite or cable TV.[108]\\nThe BBC was forced to apologise after many viewers complained about \"over-talking\" by its commentary team during the TV coverage of the event in 2011. It said in a statement that views on commentary were subjective but that they \"do appreciate that over-talking can irritate our audience\". The BBC added that it hoped it had achieved \"the right balance\" across its coverage and was \"of course sorry if on occasion you have not been satisfied\". Tim Henman and John McEnroe were among the ex-players commentating.[109]\\nWimbledon was also involved in a piece of television history, when on 1 July 1967 the first official colour television broadcast took place in the UK. Four hours live coverage of the 1967 Championships was shown on BBC Two, which was the first television channel in Europe to regularly broadcast in colour. Footage of that historic match no longer survives, however, the Gentlemen\\'s Final of that year is still held in the BBC archives because it was the first Gentlemen\\'s Final transmitted in colour. The tennis balls used were traditionally white, but were switched to yellow in 1986 to make them stand out for colour television.[110] Since 2007, Wimbledon matches have been transmitted in high-definition, originally on the BBC\\'s free-to-air channel BBC HD, with continual live coverage during the tournament of Centre Court and Court No. 1 as well as an evening highlights show Today at Wimbledon. Coverage is now shown on BBC One and Two\\'s HD feeds. Beginning 2018, all centre court matches are televised in 4K ultra-high-definition.[111]\\nThe BBC\\'s opening theme music for Wimbledon was composed by Keith Mansfield and is titled \"Light and Tuneful\". A piece titled \"A Sporting Occasion\" is the traditional closing theme. The finally notes of this theme are regularly used to end BBC One and BBC Two Wimbledon transmissions. For the end of broadcast at the conclusion of the tournament a montage set to popular music is traditionally used instead. Mansfield also composed the piece \"World Champion\", used by NBC during intervals (change-overs, set breaks, etc.) and at the close of broadcasts throughout the tournament.\\nIreland\\n[edit]\\nIn Ireland, RTÉ broadcast the tournament during the 1980s and 1990s on their second channel RTÉ Two, they also provided highlights of the games in the evening. The commentary provided was given by Matt Doyle a former Irish-American professional tennis player and Jim Sherwin a former RTÉ newsreader. Caroline Murphy was the presenter of the programme. RTÉ made the decision in 1998 to discontinue broadcasting the tournament due to falling viewing figures and the large number of viewers watching on the BBC.[112] From 2005 until 2014 TG4 Ireland\\'s Irish-language broadcaster provided coverage of the tournament. Live coverage was provided in the Irish language while they broadcast highlights in English at night.[113]\\nIn 2015 Wimbledon moved to pay TV broadcaster Setanta Sports under a 3-year agreement.[114] Its successor, Eir Sport, took over broadcasting rights in Ireland until its demise in 2021.\\nAmericas\\n[edit]\\nIn the United States, ABC began showing taped highlights of the Wimbledon Gentlemen\\'s Singles Final in the 1960s on its Wide World of Sports series. NBC began a 43-year run of covering Wimbledon in 1969, with same-day taped (and often edited) coverage of the Gentlemen\\'s Singles Final. In 1979, the network began carrying the Gentlemen\\'s Singles Final live, and in 1982, the Ladies\\' Singles Final. For the next few decades, NBC aired \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\" specials on weekends.[115] Live coverage started early in the morning (the US being a minimum of 5 hours behind the UK) and continued well into the afternoon, interspersed with commentary and interviews from Bud Collins. Collins was sacked by NBC in 2007, but was promptly hired by ESPN, the cable home for The Championships in the States. For many years NBC\\'s primary Wimbledon host was veteran broadcaster Dick Enberg.\\nFrom 1975 to 1999, premium channel HBO carried weekday coverage of Wimbledon. Hosts included Jim Lampley, Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, John Lloyd and Barry MacKay among others.[116] ESPN took over as the cable-television partner in 2003.[117]\\nThe AELTC grew frustrated with NBC\\'s policy of waiting to begin its quarterfinal and semifinal coverage until after the conclusion of Today at 10 a.m. local, as well as broadcasting live only to the Eastern Time Zone and using tape-delay in all others. NBC also held over high-profile matches for delayed broadcast in its window, regardless of any ongoing matches. In one notorious incident in 2009, ESPN2\\'s coverage of the Tommy Haas–Novak Djokovic quarterfinal was forced off the air nationwide when it ran past 10 a.m. Eastern, after which NBC showed the conclusion of the match on tape only after presenting the previous Ivo Karlović–Roger Federer quarterfinal in full.[118] Beginning with the 2012 tournament, coverage moved to ESPN and ESPN2, marking the second major tennis championship (after the Australian Open) where live coverage is exclusively on pay television, while ESPN Deportes provides coverage in Spanish. The Finals are also broadcast tape-delayed on ABC.[119] On 9 July 2021, ESPN and the AELTC reached an agreement to extend ESPN\\'s coverage for 12 years, beginning 2024 until 2035. This agreement included live coverage of the middle weekend on ABC starting in 2022, following the announcement that play would occur on the middle Sunday, historically a rest day.[120]\\nTaped coverage using the world feed is aired in primetime and overnights on Tennis Channel and is branded Wimbledon Primetime.\\nIn Canada, coverage of Wimbledon is exclusively carried by TSN and RDS, which are co-owned by Bell Media and ESPN. Prior to 2012, CBC Television and SRC were the primary broadcaster of Wimbledon for Canada, and its live coverage of the tournament predated \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\" by over a decade, Canada being at least four hours from its fellow Commonwealth realm.\\nIn Mexico, the Televisa family of networks has aired Wimbledon since the early 1960s. Presently, most weekend matches are broadcast through Canal 5 with the weekday matches broadcast on the Televisa Deportes Network. As Mexico is six hours behind the U.K., some Canal 5 affiliates air the weekend matches as the first program of the day after sign-on. Although Mexico had begun broadcasting in colour in 1962, Wimbledon continued to air in black and white in Mexico until colour television came to the United Kingdom in 1967.\\nIn most of the remainder of Latin America, Wimbledon airs on ESPN, as do the other Grand Slam tournaments. In Brazil, SporTV has exclusive rights to the broadcast.\\nOther countries\\n[edit]\\nIn several European countries, Wimbledon is shown live on Eurosport 1, Eurosport 2 and the Eurosport Player. Although there are some exceptions, as in Denmark, where the Danish TV2 holds the right to show matches until 2022 and in Italy where Sky Sport and SuperTennis holds the rights to show live matches until 2022. In the Netherlands Center Court is shown live on Eurosport 1 and all other courts are shown live on the Eurosport Player. But Court One is covered live on Ziggo Sport/Ziggo Sport Select. Wimbledon has been exclusively broadcast on Sky Sport in Germany since 2007.[121] In December 2018, Sky extended its contract for Austria, Germany and Switzerland until 2022.[122]\\nIn Australia, the free-to-air Nine Network covered Wimbledon for almost 40 years but decided to drop their broadcast following the 2010 tournament, citing declining ratings and desire to use money saved to bid on other sports coverage. In April 2011, it was announced that the Seven Network, the then-host broadcaster of the Australian Open, along with its sister channel 7Two would broadcast the event from 2011. Pay television network Fox Sports Australia also covered the event. Free-to-air coverage returned to Nine Network in 2021. In India and its Subcontinental region, it is broadcast on Star Sports. In Pakistan it is broadcast on PTV Sports.\\nCoverage is free-to-air in New Zealand through TVNZ One, beginning each night at 11 pm (midday in London). In 2017 their new channel, TVNZ Duke (also free-to-air), carried an alternative to the main feed, including (for example) matches on outside courts involving New Zealand players.\\nFox Sports Asia held broadcasting rights across Southeast Asia from 1992 until network\\'s shutdown in 2021. SPOTV currently holds broadcasting rights across Southeast Asia.\\nMost matches are also available for viewing through internet betting websites and other live streaming services, as television cameras are set up to provide continuous coverage on nearly all the courts.\\nTrophies, prize money and ranking points\\n[edit]\\nTrophies\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe Ladies\\' (top) and Gentlemen\\'s singles trophies\\nThe Gentlemen\\'s Singles champion is presented with a silver gilt cup 18.5\\xa0inches (about 47\\xa0cm) in height and 7.5\\xa0inches (about 19\\xa0cm) in diameter. The trophy is decorated with a variety of symbols, including a miniature gold pineapple. The trophy has been awarded since 1887 and bears the inscription: \"All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Championship of the World\". The actual trophy remains the property of the All England Club in their museum, so the champion receives a three-quarter size replica of the Cup bearing the names of all past Champions (height 13.5 inches, 34\\xa0cm).[123]\\nThe Ladies\\' Singles champion is presented with a sterling silver salver commonly known as the \"Venus Rosewater Dish\", or simply the \"Rosewater Dish\". The salver, which is 18.75\\xa0inches (about 48\\xa0cm) in diameter, is decorated with figures from mythology. The actual dish remains the property of the All England Club in their museum, so the champion receives a miniature replica bearing the names of all past Champions. From 1949 to 2006 the replica was 8 inches in diameter, and since 2007 it has been a three-quarter size replica with a diameter of 13.5 inches.[123]\\nThe winner of the Gentlemen\\'s Doubles, Ladies\\' Doubles, and Mixed Doubles events receive silver cups. A trophy is awarded to each player in the Doubles pair, unlike the other Grand Slam tournaments where the winning Doubles duo shares a single trophy. The Gentlemen\\'s Doubles silver challenge cup was originally from the Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club and donated to the All England Club in 1884. The Ladies\\' Doubles Trophy, a silver cup and cover known as The Duchess of Kent Challenge Cup, was presented to the All England Club in 1949 by The Duchess of Kent. The Mixed Doubles Trophy is a silver challenge cup and cover presented to the All England Club by the family of two-time Wimbledon doubles winner Sydney Smith.[123][124]\\n\\nTodd Woodbridge holding the Gentlemen\\'s doubles silver challenge cup in 2004\\nThe runner-up in each event receives an inscribed silver plate. The trophies are usually presented by the Patron of the All England Club, The Princess of Wales.\\nPrize money\\n[edit]\\nPrize money was first awarded in 1968, the year that professional players were allowed to compete in the Championships for the first time. Total prize money was £26,150; the winner of the men\\'s title earned £2,000 (equivalent to £43,800 in 2023) while the women\\'s singles champion received £750 (equivalent to £16,400 in 2023)[125].[126][127] In 2007, Wimbledon and the French Open became the last grand slam tournaments to award unequal prize money to women and men.[128][129][130]\\n| Year | Gentlemen\\'s Singles |

Obviously it was a great match for me,” Alcaraz said.\\n“Obviously Novak didn't play his best the first two sets, a lot of mistakes. I made the most of that.\\n“It is a great feeling even thinking about being French Open winner and Wimbledon champion the same year, that few players just done it before. It's unbelievable.\\n“I try to realise that I won Wimbledon twice and try to feel that it was the same feeling as last year.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt must be said Alcaraz was not facing the version of Djokovic who fought him for more than four-and-a-half hours in last year’s Wimbledon final.\\nThis year’s rematch could have been even more one-sided had Alcaraz converted one of three championship points he held on serve at 5-4, 40-0 in the third set.\\nDjokovic, now 37, was appearing in his first final of 2024 and just over a month earlier had undergone surgery to repair a meniscus tear.\\nStill, he had outplayed fourth-round opponent Holger Rune and semifinal foe Lorenzo Musetti in straight-sets masterclasses, and had also beaten Alcaraz in their two previous meetings.\\nAlcaraz was certainly not taking the 24-time major champion lightly.\\n“The work that Novak has done has been unbelievable. Put himself the chance to be able to play the tournament and making the final, it's something out of this world for me,” Alcaraz said.\\n“I beat him today, but for me Novak is still being like a Superman.”\\nBeating ‘Superman’ in last year’s Wimbledon final was one of two matches which had a profound impact on Alcaraz and contributed to the result on Sunday.\\nHe’d learned from what he’d done wrong at moments in the 2023 decider and tried not to repeat it, and felt much calmer prior to this final.\\n“I felt like I wasn't new any more. I've been in this situation before,” he said.\\n“I managed pretty well the match. I remember in that last year final, it was pretty different things. Really much better for me (this time around).”\\nHe’d also learned plenty from his semifinal loss to Daniil Medvedev at last year’s US Open, where he was defending champion.\\nAlcaraz said at the time he was not mature enough to handle such matches, and vowed things would be different as his career progressed.\\n“I remember perfectly. I gave up a little bit in the second set after losing the first one,” Alcaraz recalled. “It's something that is unacceptable playing in a Grand Slam. I knew that these things can't happen again.”\\nAlcaraz has lost just one Grand Slam match since that moment.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it is not only mental gains that demonstrate his growth. He is wielding a more improved, bigger game on court, too.\\nAlcaraz averaged a first-serve speed of 196km/h against Djokovic – his equal-fastest of the tournament, along with his third-round match against Frances Tiafoe – and sent down his fastest serve of the fortnight at 218km/h.\\n“I've never seen him serve that way, to be honest. 136 (miles per hour). Maybe I was missing something this tournament, but I've never seen him serve that fast,” Djokovic said.\\n“Overall he really outplayed me.”\\nAlcaraz acknowledged he had been specifically practising his serve during the fortnight, and that it was part of an overall focus to “keep improving everything”.\\nMore on Carlos Alcaraz\\n\\n\\n Alcaraz wins Roland Garros: “This one is the most that I am proud about myself” NEWS\\n\\n\\n Alcaraz “could win 10 Roland Garroses”, says McNamee NEWS\\n\\n\\nBut there are bigger-picture goals in mind for the Spaniard, who at 21 years of age already owns major titles on all three surfaces and is achieving feats at his age only a select few greats have managed before him.\\nAlcaraz is targeting tennis immortality, and Sunday’s triumph at the All England Club put him a small step closer to just that.\\n“At the end of my career, I want to sit at the same table as the big guys,” said Alcaraz, who evened his head-to-head record against Djokovic at 3-3.\\n“That's my main goal. That's my dream right now. It doesn't matter if I already won four Grand Slams at the age of 21. If I'm not keep going, all these tournaments for me, it doesn't matter.\\n“I will try to keep winning and end my career with a lot of them. I don't know what is my limit. I don't want to think about it. I just want to keep enjoying my moment, just to keep dreaming. Let's see if at the end of my career it's going to be 25, 30, 15, four. I don't know.\\n“All I want to say is I want to keep enjoy, and let's see what is the future bring to me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroadcast Partners\\nContact\\nPrivacy Policy\\nPrivacy Statement\\n\\nConditions of use\\n\\n\\nGrand Slams\\n\\nEmployment\\nMedia Accreditation\\nPartners\\nVendors\\n\\nCompetitions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2025 Tennis Australia.\\nTennis Australia acknowledges that the AO is held on Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Country and we extend our respects to Elders past and present and to all First Nations People.\"},\n",

A year ago in the Wimbledon final against Novak Djokovic, Alcaraz got off to a slow start, dropped the opening set and needed five to claim his first championship at the All England Club.\\nSunday’s rematch began with a game that felt monumental: 20 points across nearly 15 minutes, portending an engrossing, back-and forth contest — and a long one. There were moments of brilliance from both men. Alcaraz, though, was better. Just as he would be for nearly all of the next two hours.\\nAlcaraz learned from 2023 and applied those lessons to 2024, adding up to a 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (4) victory over Djokovic for a second consecutive Wimbledon championship and fourth Grand Slam title in all. And to think: He is still just 21.\\n“At the end of my career, I want to sit at the same table as the big guys,” said Alcaraz, who won the French Open last month and, after receiving Wimbledon’s gold trophy from Kate, the Princes of Wales, is now just the sixth man to triumph on the red clay at Roland Garros and the grass at the All England Club in the same season. “That’s my main goal. That’s my dream right now.”\\nAlcaraz improved to 4-0 in major finals, including at the 2022 U.S. Open; only Roger Federer got off to a better start to a career among men, going 7-0.\\nRELATED COVERAGE\\n  [![Image 52: Spectators watch a match at the Italy Major Premier Padel tournament in Rome, Wednesday, July 12, 2023.

Everything.”\\nFor Alcaraz, there was one brief blip, a five-point stretch that took him from the verge of victory to close to a collapse. It happened when he was a point from the championship while serving at 5-4, 40-love. But he double-faulted. Then missed a backhand. Then a volley. Then a forehand. And another forehand. Suddenly, it was 5-all. Suddenly, Alcaraz appeared rattled. Suddenly, Djokovic could hope.\\nSuddenly, there was intrigue.\\nBut only briefly. Alcaraz regrouped, got to the tiebreaker, then closed things out.\\nLast year, Djokovic recalled, “We went toe to toe.”\\n“This year,” he continued, “it was nothing like that. It was all about him.

He put a volley into the net to fall behind by a break to begin the second, then double-faulted to end that one. Finally, in the third, Djokovic perked up a bit, registering his only break of serve all day, as spectators chanted his two-syllable nickname — “No-le! No-le!” — while others replied with choruses of “Let’s go, Carlos! Let’s go!”\\nStill, this was not the body-contorting, get-to-everything Djokovic everyone is accustomed to seeing, which makes sense considering there were serious questions about whether it would be possible to even participate at Wimbledon.\\nAgainst Alcaraz, Djokovic occasionally hopped awkwardly when he landed after serving or stepped gingerly — as if barefoot on a beach’s hot sand — between points. Missing volleys he usually makes, Djokovic won just 27 of 53 points when he went to the net. After netting a volley to close one early 11-stroke exchange, Djokovic sighed and walked to his sideline seat to grab a purple-and-green towel for dabbing at sweat. His facial expression was saying: “Come on, Carlitos, pick on someone your own age.”\\nAlcaraz was outstanding in pretty much every way, from the basic to the sorts of shots no one else would even try. Once, he leaped and wrapped his racket all the way around his back to get the ball over the net, although Djokovic did put an overhead away to get that point. Alcaraz ran wide of the doubles alley for forehand winners. Claimed points via drop shots. Smacked serves at up to 136 mph (219 kph). Accumulated 14 break points, converting five, and faced just three.\\nWhat can’t Alcaraz do?\\n  ![Image 59: Carlos Alcaraz, left, of Spain is congratulated by Novak Djokovic of Serbia after winning the men's singles final at the Wimbledon tennis championships in London, Sunday, July 14, 2024.

As the tennis season wound down, Swiatek had every reason to stick with the formula that had delivered her to the top of the mountain. Instead, she floated the idea of spending part of her off-season training — on grass.\\nShe would not play another grass-court tournament for nearly eight months. Tennis spends the first three months of the season on hard courts. The Australian Open, a classic hard-court event, was a little more than six weeks away.\\nNone of this stopped visions of tennis on the sport’s ultimate grass, at Wimbledon’s All England Club, dancing through her mind. “I had these ideas,” Swiatek said last month as she sat next to the French Open trophy in Paris. (Her coach had told her that these ideas were terrible.)\\nThen came the flex. “If I would lose here earlier, maybe I would be able to play two more weeks on grass, and then be a better grass player.”\\nAh, the champion’s lament — and in Swiatek’s case a very specific one. She’s a wondrous player; a generational talent who could quit tomorrow and walk into the Hall of Fame. But the Pole, like so many who have come before her, knows that her career will remain incomplete unless she wins Wimbledon.\\nHere is why.\\n GO FURTHER Why Wimbledon is the Grand Slam title that every player craves\\n July 14, 2024 at 1:30 PM EDT Max Mathews· Live Reporter\\n\\nPlay of the day?\\nBrilliant point from Alcaraz.\\n July 14, 2024 at 1:22 PM EDT Max Mathews· Live Reporter\\n\\nFirst set to the favourites\\nSeventh seeds Jan Zielinski and Hsieh Su-wei have just taken the first set 6-4 in the mixed doubles final against unseeded Mexicans Santiago Gonzalez and Giuliana Olmos.\\nOne down, one to go...\\n July 14, 2024 at 1:20 PM EDT Charlie Eccleshare· Tennis Writer in Melbourne\\n\\nHot-stepper Alcaraz?\\nAlcaraz answering the question of whether he\\'s a good dancer in the most sportsperson way: \"Let\\'s see tonight, but I try to do my best.\"\\n July 14, 2024 at 1:10 PM EDT Charlie Eccleshare· Tennis Writer in Melbourne\\n\\nAll-round mastery: How Alcaraz completed the \\'surface Slam\\'\\n\\nGetty Images\\nBecoming the youngest man to win a Grand Slam title on all three surfaces is a testament to two qualities that separate Carlos Alcaraz from the rest: his variety and his dedication. The feat would be impossible without them and it’s still an achievement so tough that it has eluded some of the game’s greats.\\nWinning a major on clay, hard and grass is something Pete Sampras, John McEnroe (both no clay) and Ivan Lendl (not on grass), plus otherwise all-conquering champions such as Venus Williams and Justine Henin, couldn’t muster.\\nAlcaraz has not just done it, but he’s done it at a younger age, 21, than any man previously — beating fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal’s previous record by 19 months.\\nTo understand how Alcaraz pulled this off, we have to go back a lot further than the three majors he has won: the 2022 U.S. Open, Wimbledon a year later, and the French Open, thanks to a five-set win against Alexander Zverev in a dramatic final last month.\\nRead more below.\\n GO FURTHER How Carlos Alcaraz won three Grand Slam titles on hard, grass and clay courts\\nAdvertisement\\n July 14, 2024 at 1:05 PM EDT James Hansen· Senior Tennis Editor in Melbourne\\n\\nAlcaraz found his serve at the crucial time\\nPretty good time for Alcaraz to produce his best serving performance of the tournament.\\nPretty bad time for Djokovic\\'s net play to fall off a cliff — exacerbated by the psychological pressure of Alcaraz\\'s foot speed and massive return of serve gap to everybody else.\\n July 14, 2024 at 1:00 PM EDT Charlie Eccleshare· Tennis Writer in Melbourne\\n\\nThe Briefing: How did Alcaraz meet the moment with his serve?\\n\\nThe Athletic\\nIt was fitting that Alcaraz served out this match in a tiebreak because the game in which he botched serving for the match was a complete aberration in an otherwise masterful serving performance.\\nAlcaraz came into this match with a first-serve-points won percentage of 72 for the Championships, the 68th-best in the men’s event. Serving had been a real issue, having been broken multiple times in his six matches before the final.\\nOn Sunday, he produced his best serving performance of the tournament. Alcaraz was just a point away from registering only the third completed Grand Slam tournament match in which Djokovic could not break his opponent’s serve.\\nGiving up just a single break to such a devastating returner underlined the serving rhythm he found. Alcaraz kept his speeds high, but crucially he kept hitting his spots too, and was brave with his second serves.\\nThere was one second serve at the start of the third set to get him out of a tight game that landed plum on the line and completely bamboozled Djokovic. In Sunday’s final, Wimbledon got a glimpse of how irresistible he is when this area of his game clicks.\\n July 14, 2024 at 12:55 PM EDT Matthew Futterman· Senior Tennis Writer in Melbourne\\n\\nThe Briefing: Did Djokovic need Alex de Minaur?\\nSo much had to go right for Djokovic to even get a chance to play Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final 39 days after undergoing surgery on the meniscus in his right knee. Ultimately, it might have gone too right as he looked to play himself back into shape.\\nDjokovic got lucky, not just by drawing a qualifier and a wild card in the first two rounds, but by seeing Alcaraz and world No 1 Jannik Sinner land on the other side of the draw. Then he played Alexei Popyrin, who had little Centre Court experience, and a formless Holger Rune.\\nHis next opponent posed what appeared to be a formidable test — Alex de Minaur, another Aussie, a lover of grass and, most importantly, a top-10 player with the wheels and the engine to run all day. De Minaur was even showing some newly acquired power, to hang with Djokovic when he revs through the gears.\\nBut De Minaur tore his hip cartilage and pulled out, leaving Djokovic with more rest before he played Alcaraz, five steps up in toughness. By the time he had raised his level to where it needed to be to hang with Alcaraz, Djokovic was down two sets.\\nSo much different. Too different. Everything had gone right — when he just needed a little on-court adversity to be ready for this ultimate test.\\n GO FURTHER Wimbledon final analysis: Carlos Alcaraz beats Novak Djokovic for second Wimbledon title\\n July 14, 2024 at 12:50 PM EDT Charlie Eccleshare· Tennis Writer in Melbourne\\n\\nThe Briefing: The art of playing an injured player?\\n\\nGetty Images\\nOne of tennis’ most difficult psychological tests is playing a match against an ailing opponent. That’s any match, against any ailing opponent — let alone a Wimbledon final against a 24-time Grand Slam champion.\\nJust a few games in, it was clear that Djokovic was far from full fitness — hardly a surprise just over five weeks after meniscus surgery. While a half-fit Djokovic can still take care of most of the field on grass, Alcaraz is not most of the field.\\nTennis is a sport of plans and reverting from those patterns is much trickier than it looks — but Alcaraz took full advantage of an opponent whose movement is compromised. Alcaraz ultimately gave an exhibition on how to cope with an opponent not at 100 per cent.\\nHe didn’t massively change his approach, or start indiscriminately chucking in drop shots. He played attacking, percentage tennis, taking advantage of the holes in Djokovic’s game created by his knee.\\nPredominantly, this was a performance of controlled aggression. It demonstrated the exceptional maturity of this 21-year-old.\\n July 14, 2024 at 12:45 PM EDT Matthew Futterman· Senior Tennis Writer in Melbourne\\n\\nThe Briefing: How much can a first game mean?\\nNotes from the first game of a final match. It lasted 12 minutes. There were seven deuces. Djokovic seemed like he had to hit 50 serves. A sound emanated from his lungs after each one, more moan or groan than intimidating grunt. It was too hard, too early.\\nBack and forth they go, another break-point chance for Djokovic. A big serve sets up an easy forehand into the open court, especially for a player who has won 24 Grand Slam titles. A big breath. Contact. It sails wide.\\nIt’s 1-0 Alcaraz, and it really shouldn’t matter, because first games don’t matter in five-set tennis matches, and with Djokovic, first sets barely matter either.\\nBut this game feels like it does, not just because it was hard — really hard — but because it was so much harder than so many of his first games in his 36 other Grand Slam finals. That number, ridiculous as it seems, is not wrong. It was a fitting start to a very hard afternoon.\\nRead more below.\\n GO FURTHER Wimbledon final analysis: Carlos Alcaraz beats Novak Djokovic for second Wimbledon title\\nAdvertisement\\n July 14, 2024 at 12:40 PM EDT Max Mathews· Live Reporter\\n\\nAlcaraz beams in delight\\n\\nGetty Images\\nA smile as wide as the Mediterranean.\\n July 14, 2024 at 12:35 PM EDT Max Mathews· Live Reporter\\n\\nMixed doubles finalists on court\\n\\nGetty Images\\nThere is one major match still to be played today: the mixed doubles final.\\nMexicans Santiago Gonzalez and Giuliana Olmos play seventh seeds Jan Zielinski and Hsieh Su-wei.\\n July 14, 2024 at 12:30 PM EDT Max Mathews· Live Reporter\\n\\nA generational handover?\\n\\nGetty Images\\nThe past, and the present?\\n July 14, 2024 at 12:25 PM EDT Max Mathews· Live Reporter\\n\\nJulia Roberts enjoying the entertainment\\n\\nGetty Images\\nThe famous American actress enjoying the spectacle.\\n July 14, 2024 at 12:20 PM EDT Max Mathews· Live Reporter\\n\\nGame, Set, Match: Alcaraz dispatches Djokovic for Wimbledon title\\nCarlos Alcaraz beat Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final at the All England Club 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 on Sunday.\\nThe No 3 seed prevailed over the No 2 seed in a one-sided victory, ultimately decided by Djokovic’s hampered movement after knee surgery, Alcaraz’s massively improved serve, and his psychological edge over Djokovic in net exchanges.\\nIt is Alcaraz’s second Wimbledon title and his fourth Grand Slam singles title. He completed the ‘Surface Slam‘, winning on grass, clay and hard courts, by beating Alexander Zverev in the French Open final at Roland Garros in June.\\nIt was Djokovic’s first straight-sets defeat at Wimbledon since the 2013 final, when he lost to Andy Murray.

Especially after the fiery crowd comments and the ‘air violin’ playing (which he said was for his daughter who is in the crowd today), almost nobody does drama like this guy.\\nHe was a bit of a different elder statesmen today, however. He started off with a joke and humbled himself pretty immediately by giving Alcaraz credit for ‘having it all today’.\\nI appreciated his self-reflection and gratitude and the fact that he avoided the earlier interactions he had with the crowd.\\nCombine that with a really nice at-the-net embrace he had with Carlos and this appears to be somewhat of a changed man.\\nA couple of great jokes about his son’s future in tennis as well.

      "Assistant: Hello! How can I assist you today?\n",
      "Assistant: I'm just a computer program, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here to help you! How can I assist you today?\n",
      "Assistant: The capital of India is New Delhi.\n",
      "Assistant: Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks. Here's a breakdown of key points about machine learning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data-Driven**: Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform a task.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Types of Learning**:\n",
      "   - **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from labeled data, using input-output pairs to learn the relationship between them. Common tasks include classification and regression.\n",
      "   - **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from unlabeled data, finding hidden patterns or intrinsic structures. Common tasks include clustering and association.\n",
      "   - **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training.\n",
      "   - **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns actions based on feedback from interactions with its environment, often formulated as a reward signal.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Applications**:\n",
      "   - Speech and image recognition\n",
      "   - Recommendation systems\n",
      "   - Autonomous vehicles\n",
      "   - Natural language processing\n",
      "   - Fraud detection\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Key Concepts**:\n",
      "   - **Model**: A mathematical representation created through the learning process.\n",
      "   - **Training**: The process of teaching the model by providing data.\n",
      "   - **Features**: Input variables used in making predictions.\n",
      "   - **Labels**: The output variable used in supervised learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Needs and Capabilities**:\n",
      "   - Requires large datasets for effective learning.\n",
      "   - Capable of adapting to new situations and improving over time.\n",
      "   - Enables predictive analytics and the automation of decision-making processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning is continuously evolving and is widely used in various industries to solve complex problems and improve efficiencies.\n",
      "Assistant: Generative AI (GenAI) refers to a category of artificial intelligence algorithms that create new content by learning patterns from existing data. Unlike traditional AI systems that focus on analyzing or categorizing information, generative AI can generate new data similar to the input data it was trained on. It encompasses technologies like:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Used for generating human-like text, translations, or chat responses. Examples include GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Image and Video Generation:** AI models that create realistic images or videos from textual descriptions or sample images. Examples include GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and DALL-E.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Music and Art Creation:** AI systems can generate music compositions or art pieces, mimicking the style of existing artists or creating novel styles.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Code Generation:** AI models can assist in writing code or translating code between programming languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI is widely used in industries for content creation, enhancing creativity, and improving productivity across various fields such as advertising, entertainment, and software development.\n",
